# **DC Exercises Chapter 15**

Problem 15.1

    mosaicData::CPS85 %>%
      ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = wage)) +
      geom_boxplot(aes(fill = sex))

Problem 15.3

    mosaicData::CPS85 %>%
      ggplot(aes(x = educ, y = wage, color = sex)) +
      geom_point() +
      stat_smooth(method = "lm") + #or you can use geom_smooth
      ylim(0, 15)

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'

Problem 15.5

20 ZIP Codes

1.  The relationship between the fraction of 65 and older people and the fraction in a ZIP code under 5 years old is a horizontal line. Thus, as the fraction in a ZIP code under 5 years old increases, the fraction of 65 and older people will stay relatively the same. Thus, the data does not indicate that ZIP codes with high elderly populations tend to have high child populations. In fact, the data leans toward the idea that ZIP codes with high elderly populations correlate with low child populations.

2.  The confidence bands in relation to the data points are wide in terms of relation, so there is a possibility for a relationship between the elderly and child population, but the only way to find out is if more data is gathered to see if there is a line that is non-level.

    80 ZIP Codes

    1.  The line has a downwards slope, so according to this scatterplot data, a flat line would not be consistent with the scatterplot data.

    2.  With 4 times as much data in this larger sample of 80 ZIP Codes compared to the smaller sample of 20 ZIP Codes, the confidence band heights are around ½. Thus, the ratio of the confidence bands between 20 ZIP codes and 80 ZIP codes is approximately 2.

    3.  The ratio is 2, because (1/(√20))/(1/√(80))= √(80)/√(20)= 4/2= 2, which supports the answer to part 2 of the ratio of confidence band heights, and that statistical theory indicates that the width of a confidence band based on n points goes as 1/√(n).
